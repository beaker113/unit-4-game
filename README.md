# unit-4-game
This is a simple game created using Jquery.
The crystals on the page are dynamically added to the html and uses a for loop that
assigns each one a random value each time the player wins and loses.
The goal number is between 1 and 120 using the math.random method.
if statements are used to determine if the player has met the goal number resulting in a win or if the player has gone over the goal number resulting in a loss.
